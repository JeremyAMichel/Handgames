            Oh come on ! You really need an explanation on how to play this game ? Okay okay here it goes, you can choose between 3 moves, rock paper or scissors.
            <ul>
                <li>Paper beats rock</li>
                <li>Rock beats scissors</li>
                <li>Scissors beats paper</li>
            </ul>
            If anyone plays "well" just stop being friend with them they don't deserve you, they are monsters.
